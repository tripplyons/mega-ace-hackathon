# Mega Ace Hackathon Project: NFT Call Options

## Overview

An Algorand smart contract and dapp that allows NFT holders to sell options against their NFTs, and allows other users to buy those options.

## Option Mechanics

- Equity settled: the option is settled by transferring the NFT to the buyer for a strike price
- European style: this can only be done once, before the expiry date
- Call option: the buyer has the right to buy the NFT from the seller for a strike price
